# Passion Dental Server Standards

## Summary

At Passion, we believe in forward thinking dental care. That extends to our choices of equipment, including servers. We intentionally engineer our solutions to not only meet the needs of today, but those of tomorrow. Below you'll find the details of our standards when it comes to engineering our servers.

Our servers are powerful, fault tolerant, enterprise-grade, and performance optimized.

## Why upgrade?

Many times, servers are out-dated, poorly equipped, or simply failing and we feel it's critical to replace mission critical equipment before it causes downtime for the clinic.

## CPU

We aim to have at least 3.0Ghz with as many cores as possible while supporting at least 2 physical processors per server.

## Memory

Ideally, we have at least 256GB of memory with at least 16GB sized chips.

## Hard Drives

We use SAS-based hard drives that are either flash or at least 10k rpm spinning disks.

## iLO

In an effort to improve up-time and reduce our need for clinical staff's assistance, we use HPE branded servers with a lights out interface, allowing us to do many maintenance activities without physical access to the server.

## Hypervisor

We use VMWare's ESXi hypervisor because its the most reliable and secure virtualization technology in the world.
