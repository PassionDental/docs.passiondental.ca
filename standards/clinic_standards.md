#### Four-post option

For larger clinics with the requirement for a more powerful server, we recommend a four-post enclosure for the server. The patch panels are to be installed on the top of the cabinet on either the back or front of the cabinet.

## Network Cabling

### Wiring

All cabling should be CAT 5e or better. Any new installations should use CAT 6 or better.

### Terminations

All terminations should use RJ45 keystone jacks (i.e. not RJ45 crystals). On the network switch end, we require a patch panel. Existing patch panels or keystone jacks must be CAT 5e or better and new installations should be CAT 6 or better.
