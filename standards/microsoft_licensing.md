# Passion Dental Microsoft Licensing

This document serves as the licensing strategy and policy for Passion's strategy with Microsoft licensing. Microsoft adopts some of the most complex and intrusive licensing strategies. Passion has adopted a streamlined approach to licensing to ensure the least fiscal responsibility, including intangible burdens, such as lengthy internal audit procedures.

## Microsoft Office 365 Strategy

Every Passion employee is provisioned a Passion account. Passion accounts are required for the following reasons:

* Access to the computer system at the clinic
* Access to Yammer, the Passion's primary communication mechenism

These accounts are provisioned with the Microsoft 365 F1 license. These licenses do *not* include the ability to use their email.

## Email

In an effort to simplify management and license management, we're using Office 365 as our exchange server.

## Microsoft Office

Office licensing is purchased through Office 365. For terminal servers, we will purchase Office 365 per device licensing.

## Windows

### AWS

For now, we are purchasing Windows license with the instances. When a certain scale is reached, we will can bring our ELA and use our own Microsoft licenses on the platform.

### On premise

We plan to enter an ELA with Microsoft and purchase our licenses with Software assurance, bringing the long term cost of ownership down. When the initial purchase(s) are made, the cost is slightly higher but future updates (i.e. upgrading from Server 2019 to Server 2022) is less expansive.
