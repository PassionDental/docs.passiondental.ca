# Passion Dental Group Wifi

We have three SSID (i.e. networks) used for wifi services at Passion Dental Group. Below is a description of each and their intended use case.

## Clinic Devices

`Clinic Devices` is used for Passion-managed devices such as corporately issued laptops, imaging equipment, or corporate-managed phones. Currently, the password is managed by Passion IT and not given out to staff.

## Clinic Guest

`Clinic Guest` is an open network for Passion clients. The password is `Welcome123` and a splash page is presented to accept the terms of service. This network locked down, preventing unauthorized access and also limits the available bandwidth to prevent an impact to Passion's operations.

## Clinic Staff

`Clinic Staff` is used for staff members on their personal phones, laptops, and tablets. It does not have bandwith limitations and provides access to the internal network. In the future, you will use your Passion account for access to this network but in the meantime, you can reach out to the IT team for access at `itadmin@passiondental.ca`.
