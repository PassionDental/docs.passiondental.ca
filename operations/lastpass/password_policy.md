# Passion Dental Group Password Policy

## Overview

Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of Passion’s entire corporate network. As such, all Passion employees or volunteers/directors (including contractors and vendors with access to Passion systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the creation of strong passwords, the protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change.

## Audience

This policy applies to all personnel or volunteers/directors who have, or are responsible for, an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any Passion facility, has access to the Passion network, or stores any non-public Passion information.

•	{COMPANY-NAME} passwords must not be shared with anyone, including co-workers, managers, or family members, while on vacation.
•	Passwords must not be written down and stored anywhere in any office. Passwords must not be stored in a file on a computer system or mobile device (phone, tablet) without encryption.
•	If the security of an account is in question, the password must be changed immediately. In the event passwords are found or discovered, the following steps must be taken:
o	Take control of the passwords and protect them
o	Report the discovery to IT
•	Users cannot circumvent password entry with an auto logon, application remembering, embedded scripts, or hard coded passwords in client software. Exceptions may be made for specific applications (like automated backup processes) with the approval of IT. For an exception to be approved, there must be a procedure to change the passwords.
