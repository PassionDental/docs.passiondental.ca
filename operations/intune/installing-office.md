# Microsoft Office at Passion Dental Group

## Overview

We are in the process of signing an Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) with Microsoft. Once we do, we plan to use shared device licensing via Office 365. Until then, we alos have a volume license approach available. Please see below for options on that:

### Volume License Install Instructions

* Download a copy of our configuration and office deployment tool from here: `\\pgfs01.ad.passiondental.ca\IT\install_media\Office\passion_volume_license.zip`
* Extract the files
* Open a powershell window
* `cd` to the path of the extracted files
* Run `.\setup.exe /configure .\Passion_Volume_License.xml`
* It will take a while...
* When the command completes in Powershell, the installation was successful. 

Note: our configuration install the following office Products: Word, Powerpoint, Excel, and Outlook. If you need other office features, please reach out to IT at support@passiondental.ca
