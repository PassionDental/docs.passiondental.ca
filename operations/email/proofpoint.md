# Passion Dental Email Security

## Overview

At Passion dental, we use Proofpoint email security to prevent spam, spoofing, and phishing attempts. 

## Digests

Every four (4) hours, you will get an email from Proofpoint with any emails placed into quaratine. You have the option to preview and release each message.

## DKIM failures

If you get a message with "DKIM Failure" in the subject line, this means the message has not been signed by the mail server and *may be spoofed* message.

## Support

If you're having any other challenges, please send an email to support@passiondental.ca to make a ticket.
