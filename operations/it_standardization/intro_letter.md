# IT Standardization Introduction

Firstly, congratulations! We are excited for you to join the Passion family. Whether you've been with the company for a long time or you're just joining now, the IT team is excited to work more closely with your team. We've carefully planned the experience to be the least disruptive for your team so you can enjoy the best uptime with the least headache. 

## What can you expect?

In short, some changes. We will perform a survey to determine your current state IT-wise. After that, we will work internally to come up with a proposed plan and then review it with you during a 'kick-off' conference call. During the project, we will complete the following changes:

* Standardize the clinic infrastructure
  * Structured cabling
  * Standard rack
  * Standard networking equipment
  * Standard uninterrupted power supply
  * Standard server, if required
  * Standard workstations, if required
* Migrating website domain
  * **Note:** IT does not change your website. We only migrate the domain registration and do not change your website itself. That is a function of marketing and outside the scope of this project.
* If applicable, migrating email services
* Creating Passion accounts for all staff members

### Passion Accounts

At Passion, we heavily utilize Passion accounts to keep in touch with our staff. Each person will have a Passion account, allowing them to use Microsoft Teams, access Yammer (our internal social media platform), and Sharepoint (our company intraweb).

**Note:** Yammer is still in development and not yet available.

For the clinic infrastructure, we break this up into four main phases:

### Site Visit 1

During Site Visit 1, we will send a contractor to perform an IT survey. During this survey, the goal is to collect the required information for us to build a floor plan and data on all your computers, servers, printers, cabling, dental equipment, software, and internet services. After this survey is completed, we will hold a kick-off call with you to go over the proposed plan and budget for the implementation.

### Site Visit 2

During Site Visit 2, contractors will come to the clinic to further assess, plan, and install new cabling. The scope of this phase varies drastically depending on the findings of Phase 1. We communicate the scope of this during our kick-off call.

### Site Visit 3

During Site Visit 3, we send an IT contractor to install the new networking equipment and we transition your network over to our new gear. You can expect some downtime while this transition happens. We will work with you to pick a time that works best and make all attempts to avoid downtime. When this change occurs, it may break remote access to your practice management system but we'll work with you to ensure the least impact to operations.

### Site Visit 4

During Site Visit 4, we transition the practice management system to our new server or migrate you to the cloud, depending on the scope of the project. This site visit consists of the most downtime and we'll work with you to plan the outage window.
